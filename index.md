## About Me

I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.seu.edu.cn), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn). My research interest includes Computer Vision, Multimodal Large Language Model, Machine Unlearning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang](https://yangxuntu.github.io) from [School of School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.seu.edu.cn), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn). During this period, I focused on ICL abilities in MLLM and on hallucination in MLLM.

I am seeking for **mphil or Phd position of 26fall**. If you are interested in my research and would like to give me an interview, please contact me by email~
